\item Prove or disprove: For any simple graph $G$, $\chi(G) \geq \delta(G),$ where $\delta(G)$ denotes the minimum degree of $G.$\\

\textbf{Answer:} Let $G$ be a $K_{3,3}$,
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Complete bipartite graph on 3 vertices.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth/4]{"Bipartite K3".png}
\end{figure}
Note that the blue and pink two coloring indicates that $\chi(G) \leq 2$ and since showing that $\chi(G) \neq 1$ is trivial we know that $\chi(G) = 2$ . By the definition of complete bipartite graph we know that $\delta(K_{m,n}) = min\{m,n\}$,  so therefore $\delta(G) = 3$.

\item (1.1.5) Prove or disprove: If every vertex of a simple graph $G$ has degree 2, then $G$ must contain a cycle.\\

\textbf{Proof}(Contradiction:) Suppose a simple graph $G$ has degree 2, and that $G$ is acyclic. Now consider the longest path $l$ in $G$, with end vertices $a$ and $z$. Since each vertex in graph $G$ has degree 2 and $G$ is acyclic, vertices $a$ and $z$ must both be adjacent to vertices not contained inside the path $l$. Therefore $l$ is both the longest path and not the longest path.

	\draw (\i+22.5:2cm) -- (\i+67.5:2cm);

	\draw (\i+22.5:2cm) -- (\i+180+22.5:2cm);}

\textbf{Answer:} Consider the compliment of each graph, 

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Compliment of graphs G and H.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"Ismorphosm".png}
\end{figure}

We can see that the compliment of $G$ is composed of 2 disconnected four cycles and  the compliment of $H$ is an 8 cycle. Thus the compliments of graphs $G$ and $H$ are not isomorphic and therefore there cannot exists an edge preserving, vertex bijection between $G$ and $H$, i.e $G$ and $H$ cannot be isomorphic.

\item (1.1.26) Let $G$ be a graph of girth 4 in which every vertex has degree $n$. Prove that $G$ has at least $2n$ vertices. Determine all such graphs with exactly $2n$ vertices.\\

\textbf{Answer:} Suppose a graph $G$ with girth 4, where every vertex has degree $n$. Now consider vertex $i$ in $G$. Note that vertex $i$ must be adjacent to $n$ other vertices, which themselves, cannot be adjacent to each other, in order to avoid a 3 cycle. We can fill in the rest of graph $G$ by making each vertex that is adjacent to $i$ also adjacent to $n-1$ vertices that are not adjacent to $i$. We do this to avoid a 3 cycle and to give each vertex degree $n$. Note, that what we have described is a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ which has girth 4 when $n \geq 2$ and each vertex has degree $n$. Since graph $G$ must be a complete bipartite graph, if each vertex has degree $n$ there must be at least $2n$ vertices.
