\item (Problem A:) For the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ below, describe the automorphisms of $G_1$ and $G_2$ in terms of permutation cycles. Explain why your answer is correct. (See Figure 2.3 on page 39 of the handout for an example of the automorphisms of $C_4$ described in terms of permutation cycles.) \\

\textbf{Answer:}\\
$Aut(G_1) = \{\epsilon, (ut),(yz),(ut)(yz)\}$ We can see that the function $(ut)$ preserves (non)-adjacency and similarly with $(yz)$. Since $Aut(G_1)$ is a group it must be closed under function composition $(ut)(yz)$ must also be included. \\\\
$Aut(G_2) = \{\epsilon, (12),(67),(12)(67), (16)(27)(35), (17)(62)(35), (1627)(35), (1726)(34)\}$ This whole group can be composed from a set of 3 base permutation $\{(12),(67),(16)(27)(35), \epsilon\}$, which correspond to the symmetries on the graph. I can't seem to find any more reflection symmetries and any rotational symmetry is a composition the reflection symmetries I listed before.

\item (Problem B) Prove that for $n\geq 3,$ $Aut(C_n) \cong D_n$ where $D_n$ is the dihedral group with $2n$ elements.  \\


\textbf{Answer:} The dihedral group is defined as the group of symmetries of a regular polygon. We know that $|D_n| = 2n$ we get $n$ from the rotational symmetries and $n$ from reflection symmetries. Reflection symmetries are different depending on the parity of $n$. When $n$ is odd the axis of reflection is always between a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite edge. When $n$ is even the axis of reflection is either between two opposite vertices or two opposite edges. From here it clear that for cases $n\leq 2$ the symmetries are trivial. The isomorphism comes from the idea that any $C_n$ can be redrawn as an $n$-vertex regular polygon and therefore contains the same symmetries. Since every permutation in $Aut(C_n)$ can be described with a symmetry or composition of symmetries we get that the groups are the same.\\\\




This is my attempt at an isomorphism proof.\\
\textbf{Proof:} Consider the isomorphism $f: Aut(C_n) \to D_n$, such that $f(i) = i$.\\

Injection: Suppose $a,b \in Aut(C_n)$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$. By the definition $D_n$ we know that $f(b)$ and $f(a)$ correspond to the same symmetry of an $n$-vertex regular polygon. Note that $Aut(C_n)$ contains (non)-adjacency preserving permutations of the set $V(C_n)$ and any $C_n$ can be redrawn as an $n$-vertex regular polygon. 
Since we know that there is an injective correspondence between symmetries and permutations it must be the case that $a = b$.\\

Surjection: Suppose $b \in D_n$. Let $a$ be the permutation in $Aut(C_n)$ which corresponds to the symmetry $b$. Thus $f(a) = b$.\\

Homomorphism: Suppose $f(ab)$ where $a,b \in Aut(C_n)$. By definition $f(ab) = ab = f(a)f(b)$.\\

\item (Problem C) Prove that for $m>n\geq 1,$ $Aut(K_{m,n}) \cong S_n \times S_m$ where $S_k$ is the symmetric group of all permutations of a set of order $k.$

\textbf{Proof:} Suppose $f: Aut(K_{m,n}) \to S_n \times S_m$ such that $f(i)=(i_n,i_m)$ where $i = i_ni_m$.\\

Injection: By the definition of a complete bipartite graph we know every vertex in $V(N)$ is non-adjacent to every other vertex in $V(N)$ and adjacent to every vertex in $V(M)$. Thus $\bold{every}$ permutation of $V(N)$ is an automorphism on $K_{m,n}$ and similarly $\bold{every}$ permutation of $V(M)$ is an automorphism on $K_{m,n}$. Note that there is no permutation that maps between parts since that would not preserve adjacency. Thus for every $i \in Aut(K_{m,n})$ there exists an $i_m \in S_m$ and an $i_n \in S_n$ such that $i = i_mi_n$. Note that each permutation decomposes into a unique tuple since $m>n\geq 1$. Since our function maps this decomposition to the corresponding tuple it must be injective. \\

Surjection: Suppose a tuple $(i_m,i_n) \in S_n \times S_m$. Let $i = i_mi_n$. Note, that $i \in Aut(K_{m,n})$ by what we showed previously. Thus $f(i) = f(i_mi_n)=(i_m,i_n)$\\

Homomorphism: Suppose $f(ij)$. Note,
\begin{align*}
f(ij)&=f(ij_mij_n) \text{$\;$ Decomposing the $ij$ permutation }\\
 &= (ij_m,ij_n) \text{$\;$ Passing through the function we get the corresponding $ij$ tuple}\\
 &= (i_m,i_n)(j_m,j_n) \text{$\;$By the operation on the group $S_n \times S_m$} \\
 &= f(i)f(j) \text{$\;$Applying function definition}
\end{align*}
Thus $f$ is closed with respect to group operations.

\item (Problem D) \\
(a) Give an example with brief explanation of a graph $G$ such that $|Aut(G)|=3.$ \\

\textbf{Answer:}
Consider the following graph,
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Graph G}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{"Auto3".png}
\end{figure}
Note that graph $G$ has no reflection symmetries and 3 rotational symmetries. The automorphism group could be described as the identity, a $60\degree$ rotation and a $120\degree$ rotation. 

(b) Give an example of a graph $G$ on 12 vertices with minimum degree 2 such that $|Aut(G)|=1.$\\

\textbf{Answer:}
Consider the following graph,
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{"Auto1".png}
\end{figure}
Taking the graph from before and appending three more vertices such that we remove the two rotation symmetries and also create no reflection symmetries.

\item (Problem E) Recall that the \emph{distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$}, denoted $d(u,v)$, is the length of the shortest $uv$-path. Prove that automorphisms preserve distance. That is prove the statement below. \\ 
Let $G$ is a graph. For all $u,v \in V(G)$ and for all $\phi \in Aut(G),$ $d(u,v)=d(\phi(u),\phi(v)).$  \\

\textbf{Proof:}(Direct) Let $d(u,v) = d$ and $d(\phi(u),\phi(v)) = e$.\\

We want to show that $e \leq d$.\\
Consider the shortest $uv$-path $p = u,u_1,u_2,...,u_{d-1},v$. Note that since $\phi$ is an automorphism the $\phi(u)\phi(v)$-path $\phi(p) = \phi(u),\phi(u_1),\phi(u_2),...,\phi(u_{d-1}),\phi(v)$ must exist. Since we have proven the existence of a $\phi(u)\phi(v)$-path size $d$ it must be the case that $e \leq |\phi(p)| = d$. \\

We want to show that $d \leq e$.\\
Now consider the shortest $\phi(u)\phi(v)$-path $\phi(p) = \phi(u),\phi(u_1),\phi(u_2),...,\phi(u_{d-1}),\phi(v)$. Note that since $\phi^{-1}$is an automorphism the $uv$-path $p = u,u_1,u_2,...,u_{d-1},v$ must exist. Since we have proven the existence of a $uv$-path size $e$ it must be the case that $d \leq |p| = e$. 
Therefore $d = e$.
