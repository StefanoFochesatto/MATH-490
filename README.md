University of Alaska Math 490 Senior Seminar: Graph Theory

## Description
Senior Seminar is the capstone experience for UAFâ€™s undergraduate mathematics program. This course was 
primarily structured around student led lectures on Graph Theory. The final project was a rigourous presentation
on an open problem in mathematics. My presentation was on [variations of the art gallery problem](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-490/blob/main/Final%20Presentation/Final_Presentation.pdf).
